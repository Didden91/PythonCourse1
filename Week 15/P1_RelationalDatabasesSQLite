Time to learn a NEW programming language: SQL

Relational databases model data by storing ROWS and COLUMNS in tables.
The power of relational databases lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables
and in particular where there are MULTIPLE tables and relationships within in  query.

TERMINOLOGY

Database - contains many tables
Relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes
Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an “object” like a person or a music track
Attribute (also column or field) - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row

For now, as programmers we can just think about databases as advanced spreadsheets

SQL:

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language we use to issue commands to the database
-  Create data (a.k.a Insert)
-  Retrieve data
-  Update data
-  Delete data

Also known as CRUD operations:
(C)reate (R)etrieve (U)pdate (D)elete

Common Database Systems:

Three major Database Management Systems in wide use
-  Oracle - Large, commercial, enterprise-scale, very very tweakable
-  MySql - Simpler but very fast and scalable - commercial open source
-  SqlServer - Very nice - from Microsoft (also Access)
Many other smaller projects, free and open source
-  HSQL, SQLite, Postgres, ...
