Now to INSERT Users and Courses:

INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Jane', 'jane@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Ed', 'ed@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO User (name, email) VALUES ('Sue', 'sue@tsugi.org');

INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('Python');
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('SQL');
INSERT INTO Course (title) VALUES ('PHP');

And then to insert data into the Members connection table:

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 1, 0);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 1, 0);

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 2, 0);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 2, 1);

INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 3, 1);
INSERT INTO Member (user_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 3, 0);

Now that all the data is in, we can write a command to sort everything in a nice way.
We can look at who is in what course and in what role, and link all these tables:

SELECT User.name, Member.role, Course.title
  FROM User JOIN Member JOIN Course
  ON Member.user_id = User.id AND Member.course_id = Course.id
  ORDER BY Course.title, Member.role DESC, User.name
